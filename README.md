## React app for searching jobs powered by GitHub Jobs API. :briefcase:

This is first app created for my portfolio, it is very simple app showing various techniques such as:

- React Hooks
- API calls
- Skeleton loading
- Responsive design
- CSS styling (no frameworks used)

It is single page app where you can enter what type of work you searching and your prefered location.
After GitHub Jobs API call you can browse available jobs and see further details.
